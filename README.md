### Hey there :wave:
The pain goes away when I sit down and start up my computer.</br>
I have led astray but I found my light through languages.</br>
Oh no no no, not the languages you're thinking of.</br>
I eat hash but they aren't Brownies.</br>
I use brute force to sometimes fight my problems.</br>
But on the inside, I'm just that shy little kid that is scared of RATs.</br>
In short, Pythonista and Disc jockey where you can find him crafting software and building hardware.</br>
